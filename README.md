# Auto-Ingest-Twitter-S3-Snowfalke
This project demonstrates a real-time data ingestion pipeline that collects tweets from Twitter, processes them in real-time, and stages the data in AWS S3 before loading it into Snowflake for further analysis.

This project is a real-time tweet processing pipeline designed to fetch tweets matching specific criteria (e.g., keywords or hashtags) from Twitter, process them in real-time, and upload the data to an AWS S3 bucket for storage. The project demonstrates the integration of the Twitter API v2 with AWS S3 and using S3 as DataStage to load data into Snowflake highlights the Filtered Stream API for real-time streaming and auto-ingestion to snowflake.

- Captures live Twitter data using the Twitter REST API.
- Utilizes AWS S3 as an intermediate staging area for raw data.
- Automates data ingestion into Snowflake with Snowpipe.
- Enables querying and transformation of semi-structured data formats like JSON directly in Snowflake.


## Architecture Overview

### Components and Data Flow

The project is built on the following key components:

1. **Python Application**:
   - Captures live tweets from the Twitter REST API based on specific keywords.
   - Saves the tweet data locally in JSON format.
   - Uploads the JSON files to an AWS S3 bucket for staging.

2. **AWS S3**:
   - Acts as a staging environment to store raw tweet data.
   - Organizes files hierarchically by timestamp for easy management.
   - Triggers event notifications for new files using AWS SQS.

3. **Snowpipe**:
   - Listens for new file creation events in AWS S3.
   - Automatically ingests the raw JSON files into a Snowflake table.
   - Provides real-time data loading with minimal configuration.

4. **Snowflake**:
   - Hosts the ingested raw data in a table designed for semi-structured JSON data.
   - Supports querying, transforming, and creating secure views for analytics and reporting.

### Data Flow

1. The Python application streams live tweets from Twitter based on specified keywords and saves them locally as JSON files.
2. These files are uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket, which is configured to send event notifications.
3. AWS SQS captures the event notifications and triggers Snowpipe in Snowflake.
4. Snowpipe ingests the JSON files into Snowflake in near real-time.
5. Analysts can query and transform the data in Snowflake, leveraging its support for semi-structured data.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Automates the process of loading live Twitter data into Snowflake.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built using modular components that can handle large volumes of streaming data.
- **Semi-Structured Data Management**: Directly queries JSON data without the need for pre-processing or transformation.
- **Secure Data Access**: Creates secure views in Snowflake, enabling analysts to access data safely and efficiently.
- **Adaptability**: Can be extended to ingest data from other event-driven or streaming sources beyond Twitter.

## Use Cases

- **Social Media Analytics**:
   - Track real-time trends and sentiments on Twitter.
   - Analyze event-driven social media data for marketing and insights.

- **Streaming Data Pipelines**:
   - Apply the same architecture to other streaming data sources like IoT devices, logs, or webhooks.

- **Real-Time Data Visualization**:
   - Use ingested data to power dashboards and visualize trends in real-time.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a scalable and efficient pipeline for ingesting streaming data into Snowflake. By combining tools like AWS S3, Snowpipe, and Snowflake, the architecture ensures seamless real-time data integration and management. While the focus is on Twitter data, the principles and techniques can be applied to a wide range of streaming and event-driven data use cases.
